# laravel_blog
test_task
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the requested test task:

Set up latest Laravel(first git commit). This should be done on a branch 'master'
Create blog on the base of master (any from the internet can be used, doesn't matter which one). This should be done as a separate branch from master ('master' is a base). Let's call it 'laravel_blog'.

On the article edit page there should be two buttons:
1. 'search image', that searches random image in the internet (can be any search engine you like) by article title, and shows one without a page reload. Each time you click it - a random picture from internet based on the search should be displayed next to it.
2. 'insert image' inserts image tag with image 'found' by first button in the begining of the article.
( this should be a separate branch with 'laravel_blog' as a base, let's call it 'image_buttons').


So in the end there should be 3 branches - master, laravel_blog and image_buttons

Please use Laravel tools as much as possible.

Provide the result as a git repository (in github or bitbucket).
